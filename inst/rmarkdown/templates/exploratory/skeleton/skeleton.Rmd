## Inspect your data

Spend some time looking at your data. 

Does it conform to your expectations? Is it messy or clean? Does it have missing values? Have data types been imported correctly? 

At the very least, provide *dimensions*. 

```{r}
dim(mtcars)
```

Perhaps look at the head of your data.

```{r}
head(iris)
```

Or look at a summary:

```{r}
summary(iris)
```


Better yet, provide a glimpse at your data if this is feasible (i.e. there aren't too many columns): 

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(mtcars)
```

The _glimpse()_ function shows dimensions _and_ variable names along with data types and a few values from the columns themselves.

## EDA of single variables

Spend some time looking carefully at the distributions of individual variables. What do they look like?

If your analysis has a modelling element, look very carefully at the distribution of the target variable. Does it conform to your expectations? 


```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width)) + geom_histogram()
```



## EDA of two variables

Start to look at pairs of variables together. Can you see any relationships? 

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) + geom_boxplot()
```
